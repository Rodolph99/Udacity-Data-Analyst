# Udacity-Data-Analyst
This is a project I completed for the Udacity Nanodegree in Data Analyst.

Project 1

This database provides information on the number of gun licenses allocated to each state and the number of sales of each type of weapon on the one hand, and on the population statistics of each state on the other in United States of America, leaves to make a study of a possible relationship existing between the two parties. In the first dataset we have as columns the list of the 50 states of the USA and in the other we have as columns: state, permit, permit_recheck, handgun, long_gun, other, multiple, admin, prepawn_handgun, ..., returned_other, rentals_handgun, rentals_long_gun, private_sale_handgun, private_sale_long_gun, private_sale_other, return_to_seller_handgun, return_to_seller_long_gun return_to_seller_other, totals.

Project 2 - Data Wrangling

The tweet archive of Twitter user @dog rates, also known as WeRateDogs, is the dataset I worked to wrangle (as well as analyze and visualize). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates users' dogs and adds a lighthearted comment. The denominator of these ratings is almost always 10. however, the numerators? frequently greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? because "Brent, they're good dogs." Over 4 million people follow WeRateDogs, and it has been featured in international media.
My objective is to gather WeRateDogs Twitter data to produce insightful and reliable analyses and visualizations. Although the Twitter archive is fantastic, it only includes the most fundamental tweet data. "Wow!"-worthy analyses and visualizations require additional gathering, assessment, and cleaning.

Project 3 - ProsperLoan Data Exploration

The 113,937 loans in this data set have an average of 81 variables, such as loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many more. The variables in the data set are described in this data dictionary. All of the dataset's variables are not anticipated to be explored as part of the project goal! However, narrow your attention to exploring only 10 to 15 of them.
