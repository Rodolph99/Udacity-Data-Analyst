## Project Overview

### P1: Investigate a dataset

This database provides information on the number of gun licenses allocated to each state and the number of sales of each type of weapon on the one hand, and on the population statistics of each state on the other in United States of America, leaves to make a study of a possible relationship existing between the two parties. In the first dataset we have as columns the list of the 50 states of the USA and in the other we have as columns: state, permit, permit_recheck, handgun, long_gun, other, multiple, admin, prepawn_handgun, ..., returned_other, rentals_handgun, rentals_long_gun, private_sale_handgun, private_sale_long_gun, private_sale_other, return_to_seller_handgun, return_to_seller_long_gun return_to_seller_other, totals.

Project 2 - Data Wrangling

The data wrangling stage of the data analysis process was thoroughly covered in this chapter. We gained knowledge of terms like "messy data" and "dirty data," as well as the assessment, definition, cleaning, and testing processes. Additionally, we covered a wide range of file types and data collection techniques.
In this project, we had to deal with the messy and soiled data reality (again). We gathered information from various sources (such as the Twitter API) and noted problems with the dataset's organization and quality. We then had to work out these issues while meticulously documenting each step. The examination of the data was then the project's final goal.

Project 3 - ProsperLoan Data Exploration

The 113,937 loans in this data set have an average of 81 variables, such as loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many more. The variables in the data set are described in this data dictionary. All of the dataset's variables are not anticipated to be explored as part of the project goal! However, narrow your attention to exploring only 10 to 15 of them.
