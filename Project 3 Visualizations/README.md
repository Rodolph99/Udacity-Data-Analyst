## Dataset

This [data set](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv&sa=D&ust=1547699802003000)
contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, 
borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.
This [data dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit?usp=sharing) explains the 
variables in the data set.
The project objective is not expected to explore all of the variables in the dataset! But focus on only exploration on about 10-15 of them.

## Summary of Findings

The majority of loan applicants are in the $50,000 to $75,000 range and have employment status. The distribution of applicants' monthly income is right-skewed because there aren't many with high salaries. All borrowers have current and completed loans. All borrowers have employed statuses. The monthly income of borrowers is higher for employed, other, and full-time employment status with the prosper ratings of AA, A, and B. Applicants with income ranges of $50,000 to $75,000 have prosper ratings falling under AA, A, B, and C. Loan status was current and completed when they applied for loans. We can also clearly observe that HR prosper rating applicants have higher interest rates

Key Insights for Presentation


## Key Insights for Presentation
I started by examining the distribution of each and every numeric and categorical variable, then I performed the necessary univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses on the chosen variables. These features were my main areas of focus for the presentation.

The main conclusions reached are:

All borrowers have current and completed loans, and all borrowers are employed; the top income range for all borrowers is $50,000–74,999; the majority of borrowers are professionals and executives; the majority of borrowers have ratings or scores between 4 and 8; and the borrowers' rates follow an approximately unimodal distribution, peaking at 0.16. It's interesting to note the loan's origination amount.loration step here.We can see that the distribution is right-skewed in this instance, with multiple peaks at 4000, 10000, and 15000 USD. •There is an expected high correlation between the initial loan amount and the monthly loan payment, and there is a negative correlation between the interest rate of the borrower and the loan amount.

As a conclusion to this analysis, I state that the applicant's information regarding their income range, homeowner status, and employment status has a significant impact on the loan approval status.
